                </div>
                <p>Few Major Contributions: Improve the existing pipeline for the overall project for the MASK segmentation which improved Avg. Dice Score for the worst 20 images from .44 to 0.81. It also helped to stop the Bleeding Effect of classes and the Disconnected Contour problem. Modified the keypoint Head Network for Keypoint Model, which improved overall accuracy which reduces the number of samples from 90 to 30 for which avg euclidean distance of the point prediction was off by more than 5 Pixels.</p>

                <strong>GE X Ray-Camera Platform Features</strong>
                <div class="project-description">
                    Brief Description: Working on X-ray camera features to make the X-ray machines more smarter and efficeint to use.
                </div>
                <p>(i) Prediction Rotation Angle of Collimation Box: It is hard to put X-ray collimation precisely at ZERO angle while calibrating X-ray machines. I proposed a computer vision based solution with deep learning for predicting drift angle and auto-positioning the X-ray collimator box at desired angle. Prediction error for no case should be greater than 1°. (ii) Patient Motion Drift Visualization: Exposure to X-ray is hazardous, of the total failed X-rays ~30% failed because of the movement by the patient in the process of capturing the X-ray. Developing feature to track and display patient motion w.r.t reference frame. This will provide visual clues to the technician about the current position of the patient w.r.t to reference position.</p>

                <p>(i) Traffic Light Recognition(TLR): A TLR consists of traffic light box detection and classification into states i.e Red, Green, Yellow. Detection and classification tasks were bifurcated, we used YOLOv2 for detecting traffic light and the classification was carried out by a neural network using RGB histogram(32 bins/channel) of the traffic light box. Bosch Small Traffic Lights Dataset was used for empirical validation with an F1 score of 0.94. Please find the DEMO_VIDEO of the above method on the LISA dataset. (ii) Road Sign Recognition: Developed module for Road Sign Recognition (detection + classification) for 40 different types of road sign board. To improve the recall we formed a superclass concept by clustering the FC features of the road sign board and merging the classes belonging to the same cluster. By clustering we reduce the class number from 40 to 28 further subclassification within a superclass was carried out by SVM with HOG feature.</p>
